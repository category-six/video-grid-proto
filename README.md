# TO-DO

Please view with Firefox Developer Edition, 56.0b3. (Uses CSS Grid. Yay!)

Lots of ugly here. It's a demo, people.

- Stock footage, would prefer to have orange more to right
- Video glitch due to loop
- Video does not fill viewport height (js not implemented)
- Text box does not scale down when viewport is resized
- Rori will yell at me for terrible color implementation. :)
- Needs video 'poster', 'buffering' attributes
- Needs alternative web video formats (only mp4 at present)
- Yadda, yadda, yadda.


## Video specs

- Dimensions: 1280 x 720 (720p)
- Time: 00:04sec
- Codec: H.264 MP4
- Size: 2.3MB (this can -- and should -- improve bigly)
